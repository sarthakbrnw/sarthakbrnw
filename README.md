# whoami

15 y/o into OS design, Unix philosophy, and system-level internals.  
Learning how Linux works — from bootloaders and init to processes, filesystems, and userland.  
Mostly reading man pages, digging through `/proc`, and breaking things to learn.

> trying to understand the system, not just run it.
